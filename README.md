# 🌾 AI-Powered Rice Disease Diagnosis  
A Google Colab-based system for detecting rice diseases and providing recommendations.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to help farmers and researchers diagnose common rice diseases using AI. The system allows users to upload an image of a rice leaf, identifies the disease, and provides actionable recommendations.
